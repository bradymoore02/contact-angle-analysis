DropSnake history

known bugs
* if the image is cropped too near to the actual drop contour, the snake may become unstable.


modifications on 13 march 2006
* Corrected a user interface bug that appeared on imagej versions above 1.33 on windows
* New button "snake sequence" allows to run the snake on image sequences


modifications on 22 march 2005

* Added horizontal evolution of the boundary points for non-symmetric snake

* Added knot resampling when pressing button snake before launching evolution. Thus the snake does not need to modify much its knots number.

* The "Final curves" table is no more recreated at every launch of the plugin. If there is an existing table, new results are added to the existing one.
 

future improvements
* A open image function should be added so that it is not necessary to restart the plugin when launching a new image.
* Knot distance control at interface may be improved.
